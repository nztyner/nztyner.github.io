    <p>These are a couple of projects that I worked on during my undergrad.</p>
    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
    <ul>
    <p> My Capstone Project consisted of working with a team to digitize a client's physical data system.
      We worked with Mr. Julien Louis, the owner of J.L. Trucking Service LLC, to create an online presence
      for his business and simplify his day-to-day records of his services while gaining ways to analyze the provided data.
