      <p> I am 23 years old and was born and raised in Slidell, Louisiana. I earned my bachelors degree from
        Louisiana State University in Information Systems and Decision Scieneces while also earning my minor
        in Data Analytics.
          I have enjoyed learning for as long as I can remember, but my attention was always drawn to S.T.E.M.
          (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) related subjects. It was fascinating to learn how
          different things worked and then manipulate them to fulfill my own wants. When I learned I could pursue a
          career in which I could continue feeding that fascination while helping others, I knew what path I wanted to take.

        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, exploring new places, building LEGO sets, and watching television.
      I also enjoy attending entertainement events in my area and spending qulality time with my family and friends. </p>
