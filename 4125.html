    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
    <p> My team's Capstone Project consisted of digitizing a client's physical information system. We worked with Mr. Julien Louis, the owner of J.L. Trucking Service LLC, to create an online presence for his business and simplify his day-to-day records of his services while gaining ways to analyze the provided data.
